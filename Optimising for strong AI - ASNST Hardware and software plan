ASNST Hardware and Software Plan
 
Research Websites
Develop an action plan for building the necessary hardware and software to implement and train the conceptual Adaptive Sparse Neuro-Symbolic Transformer (ASNST) architecture.
(1) Research and outline a phased hardware prototyping plan for ASNST, focusing on components needed to efficiently handle dynamic sparsity and potential neuro-symbolic interactions. Include:
(a) Evaluation of suitable prototyping platforms (e.g., high-end FPGAs like Xilinx Alveo or Intel Stratix, potentially exploring neuromorphic research platforms if relevant for bio-inspired aspects).
(b) Key architectural considerations for the hardware prototype (e.g., memory bandwidth for sparse data, specialized compute units for conditional matrix operations, potential interfaces for symbolic co-processors).
(c) Steps for hardware description language (HDL - Verilog/VHDL) development, simulation, synthesis, and testing of core ASNST-specific operations (dynamic gating, sparse attention computation).
(2) Research and outline the software development steps required to support ASNST. Include:
(a) Necessary modifications or extensions to existing deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) to support dynamic graph execution, custom sparse operations, and integration hooks.
(b) Development plan for custom computation kernels (e.g., using CUDA, OpenCL, or SYCL) optimized for the target hardware's handling of dynamic sparsity.
(c) Design and implementation strategy for the software interface layer connecting the neural backbone to the symbolic reasoning module (API design, data serialization/deserialization).
(d) Implementation plan for the modulatory control system logic within the software framework.
(3) Research and create a guide detailing the integration process for the prototyped hardware and the developed software stack. Include:
(a) Hardware driver development requirements.
(b) Definition of the Application Programming Interface (API) between the software framework and the hardware accelerator.
(c) Data transfer protocols and optimization strategies between host CPU/GPU memory and the custom hardware.
(d) Workflow for compiling and running an ASNST model utilizing both software components and the hardware accelerator.
(4) Research and provide a broad overview of the steps and challenges involved in building and training the ASNST model itself, considering its unique components. Include:
(a) Dataset requirements and potential augmentation strategies suitable for training a neuro-symbolic model.
(b) Design of complex loss functions that incorporate both standard prediction objectives and potentially terms related to symbolic consistency or sparsity regularization.
(c) Exploration of training strategies (e.g., end-to-end, pre-training components, curriculum learning) suitable for the hybrid and dynamic nature of ASNST.
(d) Evaluation methodologies and metrics beyond standard benchmarks, potentially including measures of reasoning capability, adaptability, and computational efficiency under varying conditions.
