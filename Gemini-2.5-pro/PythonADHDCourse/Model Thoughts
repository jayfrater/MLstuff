OOP Concepts Explained
I've found resources that clearly explain the core ideas of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), such as how to define classes and create objects. I also looked into important concepts like inheritance, which allows you to build upon existing code, and the idea of bundling data and methods together, known as encapsulation. I also gained a basic understanding of polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call.
Working with Modules and Files
My research also covered how to organize Python code using modules and packages, and how to import and use both built-in and custom modules. I now understand the basics of reading from and writing to files, including how to work with different file types like JSON. This will allow me to explain how to save and load data in Python.
Handling Errors Gracefully
I've also gathered information on how to handle errors in Python using try and except blocks, which is crucial for writing robust programs. I learned about different types of errors that can occur and how to catch them specifically to prevent program crashes. Additionally, I looked into how to intentionally raise errors when needed.
Visualizing Object Relationships
To help explain OOP concepts more visually, I've researched UML class diagrams. I now understand the basic components of these diagrams and how they can represent classes, their attributes, and the relationships between them, like inheritance. This will be a valuable tool for illustrating these ideas in the course.
Next Steps for Module Three
I'm now ready to start putting together the content for Module 3, focusing on presenting these more advanced concepts in a clear and step-by-step manner. I'll use simple analogies and visual aids to make these topics easier to grasp.

SDLC Stages Clarified
I've now got a clear understanding of the different stages involved in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). This includes everything from the initial planning and gathering requirements to designing, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. I've also found some helpful visual aids like flowcharts that show how these stages connect.
Key Development Concepts
I've also looked into some important ideas that are part of the SDLC, such as understanding the difference between functional requirements (what the software does) and non-functional requirements (how well it does it). I also learned about user stories, which are short descriptions of what users want from the software. For the design phase, I explored principles like separating different parts of the software and making sure the user interface is clear and easy to use. Finally, I have a basic understanding of the different types of testing that are done to ensure the software works correctly.
Preparing for the Next Module
With this information, I'm well-prepared to create the content for Module 4, which will introduce the SDLC. My next step is to start researching the topics for Module 5, where I'll focus on how to build applications using external libraries and frameworks in Python.

Module Five Focus
I've now gathered sufficient information to start creating the content for Module 5, which will focus on building applications using Python libraries and frameworks. I have a good understanding of how to use `pip` to manage external packages and the role of `requirements.txt` for project dependencies. I also have introductory information on basic web concepts and the Flask framework, as well as the Tkinter library for creating graphical user interfaces. This will allow me to offer learners a choice based on their interests.
Project-Based Learning
For this module, I plan to use a project-driven approach, where learners will build either a simple web application with Flask or a desktop application with Tkinter. I've found several project ideas suitable for beginners, such as a to-do list or a calculator. I'll break down the chosen project into manageable steps with clear instructions and starter code to make the learning process engaging and less overwhelming.
Next Steps: Developer Practices
My next step is to research the topics for Module 6, which will cover essential developer practices. This includes understanding version control with Git and GitHub, learning how to debug code in VSCode, writing unit tests using `pytest`, and using tools for code quality like linters and formatters. I'll also look into the importance of writing good documentation.

Version Control Benefits
I've learned that using a Version Control System like Git is really important for tracking changes in code, allowing collaboration, and providing a safety net if things go wrong. Concepts like repositories, commits, branches, and merging are key to managing software projects effectively.
Debugging and Testing
I now have a good understanding of how to use the debugging tools in VSCode to find and fix errors in code. Setting breakpoints and stepping through code are essential skills. I also researched the importance of unit testing with `pytest` to ensure code works correctly and to prevent future issues.
Code Quality and Documentation
My research reinforced the value of using linters and formatters to maintain consistent and high-quality code. Additionally, I looked into how to write effective documentation using docstrings, which helps others (and my future self) understand the code.
Final Module Preparation
I'm now ready to create the content for Module 6, focusing on providing clear, step-by-step instructions for using Git, debugging in VSCode, and writing basic tests with `pytest`. I'll also emphasize the importance of code quality and documentation as professional development practices.
