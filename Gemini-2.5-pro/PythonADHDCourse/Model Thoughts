Shot 1: 

Understanding ADHD Learning
I've started by looking into how individuals with ADHD learn best, particularly in technical fields like programming. I'm focusing on strategies that can help with focus, engagement, and retaining new information. This will help me tailor the curriculum effectively.
Finding Beginner-Friendly Python Resources
I'm also searching for Python learning materials specifically designed for beginners. I'm prioritizing resources that are clear, concise, and potentially use interactive or visual methods to explain concepts. The goal is to find resources that can keep someone with ADHD engaged and help them grasp the fundamentals effectively.
Setting Up the Development Environment
My initial research also includes finding straightforward guides on how to set up VSCode for Python development. This involves installing the necessary software and extensions, as well as understanding how to use basic features like debugging tools. This will be one of the first practical steps in the curriculum.
Next Steps in Curriculum Building
Next, I plan to delve deeper into specific Python concepts, starting with the very basics and gradually moving towards more complex topics. I'll also start researching the different stages of the software development lifecycle to ensure the curriculum covers everything from initial ideas to launching a finished product.
