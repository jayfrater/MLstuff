# Full conversation history with Gemini about researching and planning a Python training course for someone with ADHD.

The idea for this came from my frustration at trying to learn Python. Having Severe ADHD (diagnosed before it was a trend on social media) makes it difficult for me to concentrate for long periods of time, especially on non-stimulating tasks. 

What I found was that a lot of online resources are great explaining the very basics, but as soon as things become deeper than basic data formats, even the most interactive tutorials either expect you to know the background information or present you with a "Wall of text" that I assume would be difficult to process for a Neurotypical brain. Its near impossible for me to learn from just reading this information, so my frustration led me to ask Gemini for assistance. 

***Note this is a work in progress and im continuing to have back and forth with Gemini to finalize something im happy with***
